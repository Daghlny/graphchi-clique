# graphchi-clique:

#use GraphChi engine to compute maximal cliques from a graph.

### Getting Started

compile your clique program: **make clique/clique_bfs**

to compute your graph: **clique/clique_bfs file YourGraphDataFile**

maybe the engine will ask you which file type of your data file, such as *edgelist* , *adjlist*.



**This Program is based on [GraphChi](https://github.com/GraphChi/graphchi-cpp/), Thanks for their work.**
